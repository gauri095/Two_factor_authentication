# Two_factor_authentication
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enhances security by requiring users to verify their identity using two different factors:  Something they know (password)  Something they have (OTP / authenticator app)

This project demonstrates the implementation of a secure login system with Two-Factor Authentication to protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
